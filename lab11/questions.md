# Question 1
You might like to look for trends in your data by month of collection across years.
Part 1: How do you sort your data by month?

-- Hover over the month column, click 'sort' -> 'number' -> 'smallest is first'

Part 2: How would you do this differently if you were instead trying to see all of your entries in chronological order?

-- I would sort by month, day, and year in the same fashion.


# Question 2
What is the major benefit of reconciliation? What did reconciliation do?

-- Reconciliation matches dataset entries to an external source like Wikidata. It can benefit the dataset by enriching it with additional information.
